The purpose of the project is to analyze police data in Chattanooga especially violent crime. There is a data dictionary at the above URL where the data can be pulled.
In order to pull the data that isn't throttled you will have to get your own API Token. The above URL will walk you through how to get the token. 
The data can also be pulled in a csv file.  

## Steps
